| CogAgent: A Visual Language Model for GUI Agents | Dec 2023 | It introduces CogAgent, an 18-billion parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. It emphasizes the model's ability to understand and interact with graphical user interfaces, which is a limitation in existing large language models like ChatGPT. CogAgent employs both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text in graphical user interfaces. The paper discusses the model's architecture, training data, and performance on various benchmarks, including text-rich and general VQA benchmarks and GUI navigation tasks. |  **Visual Language Model (VLM)**, **Web and Android GUIs**, **High and Low Image Resolution**| Link [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_zwu2CMestqSEpfn5MvTzY67DPfEIRV/]
